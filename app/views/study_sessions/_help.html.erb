  <h4>What happens to my studyhalls when I share?</h4>
  <p>
    Sharing a studyhall allows your classmates to see what you’ve been studying with your buddies. It’s a great way to collaborate even after your study sesh is over, and it lets your buddies get involved even if they were busy at the time.
