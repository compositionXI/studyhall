  <p id="notice"></p>
  <p>Studyhall is where college students go to study, share and connect with classmates.  Our platform makes studying social in a new way â€“ here students are provided with valuable tools for student note taking, homework and real-time project collaboration.</p>
  <p>Unlike traditional learning management systems (LMS) such as Blackboard, Studyhall is taking the populist approach to online education and creating a tool that is built only for students. In the platform, students will have access to an academically charged environment that only students can access. Studyhall gives college students what they should have had a long time ago: a sophisticated online instrument that enables them to collaborate with trusted peers, without worrying about the noise of other networks, professors and privacy issues.</p>
  <p>StudyHallâ€™s core team is a group of rockstar, educational gurus.</p>

            Sam is a senior at Yale University, 
            from which he will graduate with a B.A. in Economics. He became interested 
            in finance after golfing with a broker who told him that, at the ripe 
            old age of 14, he already knew enough math to be successful in financial 
            services. Though he did not find the path nearly so easy, Samâ€™s interest 
            in finance remained, and he has worked with some of the nationâ€™s leading 
            advisory firms. Samâ€™s studies at Yale will culminate in a thesis that 
            aims to identify pricing inefficiencies in bank debt
            markets.
