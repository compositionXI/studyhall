<ul><ul><p>This Agreement or any 
claim, cause of action or dispute (â€œclaimâ€) arising out of or related 
to this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of Delaware 
regardless of your country of origin or where you access Studyhall Inc., 
and notwithstanding of any conflicts of law principles and the United 
Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods. You and Studyhall 
Inc. agree that all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement 
must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in 
the state of Delaware, except as otherwise agreed by the parties or 
as described in the Arbitration Option paragraph below. You and Studyhall 
Inc. agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located 
within Delaware for the purpose of litigating all such claims. Notwithstanding 
the above, you agree that Studyhall Inc. shall still be allowed to apply 
for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) 
in any jurisdiction. </p></ul></ul>

claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) where the total amount 
of the award sought is less than $10,000, the party requesting relief 
may elect to resolve the dispute in a cost effective manner through 
binding non-appearance-based arbitration. In the event a party elects 
arbitration, they shall initiate such arbitration through an established 
alternative dispute resolution (â€œADRâ€) provider mutually agreed 
upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with 
the following rules: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, 
online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner 
shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (b) the arbitration 
shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses 
unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (c) any judgment 
on the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and may be entered 
in any court of competent jurisdiction. </p></ul></ul>
