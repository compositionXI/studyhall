          Sam is a senior at Yale University, 
          from which he will graduate with a B.A. in Economics. He became interested 
          in finance after golfing with a broker who told him that, at the ripe 
          old age of 14, he already knew enough math to be successful in financial 
          services. Though he did not find the path nearly so easy, Sam’s interest 
          in finance remained, and he has worked with some of the nation’s leading 
          advisory firms. Sam’s studies at Yale will culminate in a thesis that 
          aims to identify pricing inefficiencies in bank debt
          markets.

          Michael has assumed an advisory role 
          for StudyHall, helping make sure that all things are legit.  He’s 
          also Ross’s brother and quite a decent intramural basketball player 
          (or so he says).
