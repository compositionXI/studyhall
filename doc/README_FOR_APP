Welcome to Studyhall.com
------------------------
This is the developer documentaiton intended to get you up to speed and productive with the 
Studyhall.com application. 

Purpose of the Application
--------------------------
This application is 

Getting your environment up and running
-------------------------------
Please have Bundler, RVM, and MySQL installed before you start. With these prerequisites, your
local installation should bootstrap with the standard Rails 3 setup routine with SOLR. 

cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
vi config/database.yml 
bundle install
bundle exec rake db:setup
bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start
rails server

Setting up your data
--------------------
There is an administrative user in the db/seeds.rb file. Use this login to set up 
the course data by selecting the Course Data Import action on the You menu in the 
top navigation. If you do not see the Course Data Import option, then your user is
not set up to be an admin user. Change that by adding the admin role in the user 
table. 

Course data import file: 

db/catalog2.txt

Git Considerations
------------------
Work on a branch, then merge your changes to master as the feature is completed.
Staging deploys from the master branch. 

Important Locations

Unfuddle Considerations
-----------------------
This project is set to launch in production on January 15th, 2012. There are 5 weekly 
milestones set up in Unfuddle that lead up to that launch date. 

Milestone 1 - Delivery 12/16/2011
Milestone 2 - Delivery 12/23/2011
Milestone 3 - Delivery 12/30/2011
Milestone 4 - Delviery 01/06/2012
Milestone 5 - Final Delivery 01/13/2012

All tasks in each milestone must be completed each week in order for the delivery date to 
be reached successfully. Please: 

1. Do not work on any tasks that are not directly related to delivering features that are 
outlined in tickets in the current Milestone. 
2. Claim any tickets you will complete. 
3. Release tickets you are not ACTIVELY working on so that others may claim them. 
4. Mark a ticket RESOLVED only when you have committed the code, addded necessary test code, and TESTED the feature. 

Documentation
-------------
The application blueprint and design comps are located in the /doc folder. You 
should read these documents and familiarize yourself with the comps. The screens
should be implemented to spec as outlined in the comps unless technical limitations
or other documented decisions call for otherwise. 

The Style Guide has most of the CSS styles you'll need embedded within, although
these styles have been integrated into the SASS/SCSS already. 

Other Stuff?
------------

Intrideans: contact Pete Jackson with other questions. 

Update this README file if you find mistakes or add important procedures that
affect maintainability of the application.
